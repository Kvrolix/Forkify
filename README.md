## üìñ What I Learned

This project provided insights into modern JavaScript application development, including:

1. **State Management**:
   - Centralized application state in `model.js` for efficient data handling.
   - Used `localStorage` to persist bookmarks across sessions.

2. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Handled API requests using `async/await` and the Fetch API.
   - Implemented error handling for failed network requests.

3. **Component-Based Design**:
   - Developed modular and reusable view components for a scalable architecture.

4. **Responsive UI**:
   - Utilized `Sass` for modular and maintainable styles.
   - Implemented user feedback mechanisms like spinners, error messages, and animations.

5. **Pagination and Navigation**:
   - Managed search results with a dynamic pagination system.
   - Enabled hash-based routing for deep linking to recipes.

6. **Upload Functionality**:
   - Allowed users to add and upload recipes with real-time updates to the UI and state.

7. **Build Tools**:
   - Used `Parcel.js` for bundling, live development server, and optimized production builds.

## üåü Future Improvements

- **User Accounts**:
  - Enable user authentication for personal recipe management.

- **Advanced Filters**:
  - Add filters for dietary preferences, cooking time, and difficulty level.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Cache recipes for offline access using service workers.

- **Mobile Enhancements**:
  - Further optimize UI for small screens and touch interactions.
